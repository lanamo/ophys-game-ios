## Neuron I/O (beta)
### An iOS game of in vivo neuronal acitivity in the brain
Demo video: http://bit.ly/2fh2wTO or [download movie file](./assets/ophys_rec6_720p.mov)

The idea of the game is to make it more fun to interact with neuroscience data. Watching real-time recordings of in vivo neuronal activity in the brain is a lot of fun by itself. One interesting way to interact with such data on a touch screen (iPhone/iPad) is to have players tap onto these neurons right when they are "firing"/blinking (transient increase of fluorescence). 

The game is written in Python using [Pythonista 3](http://omz-software.com/pythonista/), and can be run on iOS devices using the [Pythonista 3](http://omz-software.com/pythonista/) App. To download the game, install [Stash](https://github.com/ywangd/stash) in Pythonista 3 and `git clone https://github.com/yueqiw/ophys-game-ios.git`.
