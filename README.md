## Neuron I/O (beta)
### An iOS game of in vivo neuronal acitivity in the brain

The idea of this game is to make it fun to interact with real-time recordings of neuronal activity in the brain. On a touch screen (iPhone/iPad), players tap onto these neurons right when they are "firing"/blinking (transient increase of fluorescence). To learn more about the data, visit [Allen Brain Observatory](http://observatory.brain-map.org/).

The game is written in Python using [Pythonista 3](http://omz-software.com/pythonista/), and can be run on iOS devices under the [Pythonista 3](http://omz-software.com/pythonista/) App. To download the game, install [Stash](https://github.com/ywangd/stash) in Pythonista 3 and `git clone https://github.com/yueqiw/ophys-game-ios.git`.
